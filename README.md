# If you are KitKat

Hey, Dude! Here are a few tutorials on python keystroke stuff. i have put the raw python in this github, with some videos of me briefly going over the examples and what to do with everything. I also expect that you have pip installed (and are able to use it, unlike my year 9 classmates), otherwise you might have a bit of a hard time! Enjoy!

# If you are not Kitkat

Here is a tutorial basically going over how to do stuff with keystrokes in python. And if you want my keylogger scripts as proper software, i will be making another repo with just that very soon. Enjoy!
